### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for stopping by. Dive into the details below to get to know me better.

As a former project manager, I've transitioned from crafting project plans and overseeing quality control to navigating the realm of data analytics. Swapping Gantt charts for SQL queries and dashboards, I'm on a journey to master the art of data-driven decision-making.

Currently, I'm sharpening my skills as a learner at Turing College, where I'm delving into the world of SQL, Tableau, and Python.
